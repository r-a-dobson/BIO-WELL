# **BIO-WELL**

**Introducing `BIOWELL`: An R package for effortlessly creating and sharing customized surveys that include the BIO-WELL scale**.

The BIO-WELL scale is an important tool for assessing the **contribution of biodiversity to human wellbeing**. The scale was developed to address the limited understanding of how interactions with nature and biodiversity impact our health and wellbeing.

With the `BIOWELL` package, you have the flexibility to **design surveys tailored to your specific research needs**. 

This **user-friendly** package provides a range of functions that **streamline the survey development process**.

# **What is the BIO-WELL scale?**

BIO-WELL is a reliable and validated scale that links biodiversity to human
wellbeing. It incorporates multi-sensory attributes of biodiversity and
ecological metrics. Five studies, involving 2962 participants, detail its
development, validation, and psychometric properties (Irvine et al., 2023). 

BIO-WELL provides a **valuable tool for researchers and decision-makers** to understand the
biodiversity-health/wellbeing relationship and evaluate interventions.

## Benefits of BIO-WELL

+ Include stem questions that specifically ask participants to consider their wellbeing in relation to **different elements of biodiversity**, such as species diversity, ecological processes, and attributes like sounds.

+ Captures the **holistic experience of biodiversity** by situating participants within a natural environment and incorporates a biopsychosocial-spiritual model of wellbeing, including **physical, emotional, cognitive, social, and spiritual domains of wellbeing**

+ Combines measures of the environment and wellbeing into a **single scale** ranging from 0 to 100.

+ Applicable to **diverse research settings**, including scenario-based studies, in situ evaluations, and studies that incorporate measures of actual and perceived biodiversity.

+ The scale's qualitative underpinning and strong psychometric properties make it a **reliable and valid instrument**.

+ It has been developed with input from the target population and **minimizes participant burden** by using a small number of response items.


# Package features

1) **Customization**: Adapt the scale to diverse research settings and environments. Whether you're studying woodlands, wetlands, urban parks, or other ecological contexts, the `BIO-WELL` package allows for easy modification of stem questions and attributes to suit the specific environment under investigation.

2) **Validity and Reliability**: Leverage the strength of the BIO-WELL scale, which has undergone rigorous validation and psychometric evaluation in previous studies. Benefit from a robust measurement tool that ensures the quality of data collected through your custom surveys.

3) **Seamless Integration**: The `BIO-WELL` package integrates the R statistical programming environment, offering a familiar platform for survey design and analysis. 

   + Upload your BIO-WELL surveys to the free **Shiny Server** for sharing surveys via URL.
    
   + Utilises free cloud storage on **Dropbox** for survey response data. 
    
   + Take advantage of **R's extensive packages** to analyse your survey response data.
    
4) **Documentation**: The package comes with comprehensive documentation, including Vignette tutorials and function examples, to assist you in utilising the `BIO-WELL` package to its full potential. 

# Get started! 

Install the `BIOWELL` package by running the line below!

```{r, eval= FALSE}
devtools::install_github("r-a-dobson/BIO-WELL")
```

There are six key stages (and associated functions) in the BIOWELL package:

1) **Activate Dropbox** - Set-up cloud storage for survey response data (`activate_dropbox()`). 

2) **Build survey** - Develop your custom BIO-WELL survey from start to finish (`build_survey()`).

3) **Create URL** - Upload your survey to the Shiny Servers and obtain survey access link to share with participants  (`create_URL()`).

4) **Download data** - Download and combine responses from survey participants into R (`download_data()`). 

5) **Evaluate survey** - Calculate key statistics including Cronbach's Alpha and Item-Total (`evaluate_survey()`). 

6) **Explore patterns** - Generate plots of BIO-WELL scores across environments and stem questions (`explore_data()`).
