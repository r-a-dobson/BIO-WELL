# BIO-WELL

**Currently under construction - visit again in a few weeks!**

Introducing `BIOWELL`: An R package that empowers researchers and practitioners to effortlessly create and share customized surveys using the **BIO-WELL scale**.

The BIO-WELL scale is an important tool for assessing the **contribution of biodiversity to human wellbeing**.It was developed to address the limited understanding of how interactions with nature and biodiversity impact our health and wellbeing.

With the `BIOWELL` package, you have the flexibility to **design surveys tailored to your specific research or evaluation needs**. 

This **user-friendly** package provides a range of functions and **tools to streamline the survey creation process**, ensuring a seamless and efficient workflow.


# What is the BIO-WELL scale?

BIO-WELL is a reliable and validated scale that links biodiversity to human
wellbeing. It incorporates multi-sensory attributes of biodiversity and
ecological metrics. Five studies, involving 2962 participants, detail its
development, validation, and psychometric properties (Irvine et al., 2023). BIO-WELL provides a
valuable tool for researchers and decision-makers to understand the
biodiversity-health/wellbeing relationship and evaluate interventions.
