# <span style="color:#0097AD; font-weight:bold">BIO-WELL</span>

<span style="color:#004A86; font-weight:bold">Introducing `BIOWELL`: An R package that empowers researchers and practitioners to effortlessly create and share customized surveys using the BIO-WELL scale</span>.

The BIO-WELL scale is an important tool for assessing the **contribution of biodiversity to human wellbeing**.It was developed to address the limited understanding of how interactions with nature and biodiversity impact our health and wellbeing.

With the `BIOWELL` package, you have the flexibility to **design surveys tailored to your specific research needs**. 

This **user-friendly** package provides a range of functions and tools to **streamline the survey creation process**, ensuring a seamless and efficient workflow.


# <span style="color:#0097AD; font-weight:bold">What is the BIO-WELL scale?</span>

BIO-WELL is a reliable and validated scale that links biodiversity to human
wellbeing. It incorporates multi-sensory attributes of biodiversity and
ecological metrics. Five studies, involving 2962 participants, detail its
development, validation, and psychometric properties (Irvine et al., 2023). BIO-WELL provides a
valuable tool for researchers and decision-makers to understand the
biodiversity-health/wellbeing relationship and evaluate interventions.

## <span style="color:#0097AD; font-weight:bold">Benefits of BIO-WELL </span>

+ Include stem questions that specifically ask participants to consider their wellbeing in relation to <span style="color:#004A86; font-weight:bold">different elements of biodiversity</span>, such as species diversity, ecological processes, and attributes like sounds.

+ Captures the <span style="color:#004A86; font-weight:bold">holistic experience of biodiversity</span> by situating participants within a natural environment and incorporates a biopsychosocial-spiritual model of wellbeing, including <span style="color:#004A86; font-weight:bold">physical, emotional, cognitive, social, and spiritual domains of wellbeing</span>

+ Combines measures of the environment and wellbeing into a <span style="color:#004A86; font-weight:bold">single scale</span>

+ Applicable to <span style="color:#004A86; font-weight:bold">diverse research settings</span>, including scenario-based studies, in situ evaluations, and studies that incorporate measures of actual and perceived biodiversity.

+ The scale's qualitative underpinning and strong psychometric properties make it a <span style="color:#004A86; font-weight:bold">reliable and valid instrument</span>.

+ It has been developed with input from the target population and <span style="color:#004A86; font-weight:bold">minimizes participant burden</span> by using a small number of response items.


# <span style="color:#0097AD; font-weight:bold">Package features </span>

1) <span style="color:#004A86; font-weight:bold">Customization</span>: Adapt the scale to diverse research settings and environments. Whether you're studying woodlands, wetlands, urban parks, or other ecological contexts, the `BIO-WELL` package allows for easy modification of stem questions and attributes to suit the specific environment under investigation.

2) <span style="color:#004A86; font-weight:bold">Validity and Reliability</span>: Leverage the strength of the BIO-WELL scale, which has undergone rigorous validation and psychometric evaluation in previous studies. Benefit from a robust measurement tool that ensures the quality of data collected through your custom surveys.

3) <span style="color:#004A86; font-weight:bold">Seamless Integration</span>: The `BIO-WELL` package seamlessly integrates with the R statistical programming environment, offering a familiar and efficient platform for survey design and analysis. 

    + Effortlessly upload your BIO-WELL surveys to the free **Shiny Server** to share surveys with participants online. 
    + Integrated free cloud storage on **Dropbox** for your survey response data. 
    + Harness the power of **R's extensive packages** to analyze and interpret your survey data.
    
4) <span style="color:#004A86; font-weight:bold">Documentation and Support</span>: The package comes with comprehensive documentation, including user guides and examples, to assist you in utilising the `BIO-WELL` package to its full potential. Additionally, a dedicated support team is available to address any inquiries or technical challenges you may encounter.

# <span style="color:#0097AD; font-weight:bold">Get started! </span>
