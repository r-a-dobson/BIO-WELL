# <span style="color:#0097AD;">Introduction</span>

In this vignette, we will focus on building surveys that include the [BIO-WELL
scale](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2022.101921) using the `BIOWELL` package
function `build_survey()`. 

In Vignette 1, you created a folder for storing your
BIO-WELL survey data, including the Dropbox token. In this folder, you will need
to save an R script named "app.R" which includes `BIOWELL::build_survey()` with
your custom arguments filled inside the function. 

It is important that **no other lines of code are included**, and that the
function is called using the **double colon operator**, instead of
`library(BIOWELL)`.

**<span style="color:#004A86;">Note: Before distributing BIO-WELL surveys, please ensure that you have followed your organisations procedures for gaining participant consent and ethics approval.</span>**

## <span style="color:#004A86;">What is the BIO-WELL scale?</span>

To investigate the impact of biodiversity on human wellbeing, there is a need
for a psychometric scale.

The [BIO-WELL scale](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2022.101921) is a reliable
and validated, self-reported wellbeing scale with strong psychometric
properties. 

The scale has been designed to investigate the
biodiversity-health/wellbeing relationship by capturing the multi-sensory,
holistic experience of biodiversity across five wellbeing domains (Table 1).

**<span style="color:#004A86;">Table 1: The five wellbeing domains included within the BIO-WELL scale</span>**
```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
knitr::kable(data.frame(Category=c("Physical wellbeing","Emotional wellbeing","Cognitive wellbeing",
                 "Social wellbeing","Spiritual wellbeing"),
                   Description = c("related to the functioning of the physical body and how one feels physically, including recovery from stress.",
                                   "the experience of positive and negative emotions and mood.",
                                   "an individual's thoughts about their life and cognitive capacity to direct attention.",
                                   "how an individual perceives their connections with others.",
                                   "concerned with meaning and connection to something greater than oneself.")))
```

These domains are measured using five labelled sliders that survey participants
can use to indicate their response to certain biodiversity attributes (Figure
1).

The values for each slider range from 0 to 100. Using the raw slider output,
scores can be interpreted as follows: low scores (0–49) indicate a positive
wellbeing response, high scores (51–100) a negative response and a score of 50
was considered neutral.

BIO-WELL scores are calculated by taking the mean value across all wellbeing
response items (the five sliders).

**<span style="color:#004A86;">However, to aid interpretability scores can be inverted (0–49 = negative wellbeing; 51–100 = positive wellbeing)</span>**

# <span style="color:#0097AD;">Survey sections</span>

BIO-WELL surveys are split into six key sections that can be customised using
arguments within the `BIOWELL` package function `build_survey()`:

1) Sidebar - These are details that the participants will see throughout the
survey. 

2) Screening - Here you can ask questions where certain responses will remove
the participant from completing the rest of the survey.

3) Start - An opportunity to ask questions prior to the BIO-WELL questions. 

4) BIO-WELL - For each situation given, a page with questions will be generated.
Each question will be accompanied by the five sliders included in the BIO-WELL
scale.

5) End - An opportunity to ask questions following the BIO-WELL questions 

6) Report (optional) - After a participants submits their survey responses, if
desired, a page is loaded that summarises their BIO-WELL scores and relates
these to that of other survey participants.

Below, we outline and describe the arguments that can be used to customise the
survey to your research at each stage.

# <span style="color:#0097AD;">Section 1: Sidebar </span>

+ `survey_title` - Text summarizing the topic of your survey

+ `sidepanel_message`- Text containing general information for survey participants.

+ `organisation_website` - Valid URL for organisation running the survey.

+ `organisation`- Name of organisation running the survey.

```{r}
survey_title = "Forest biodiversity and human wellbeing"
sidepanel_message= "The questions in this survey are designed to explore how forest biodiversity impacts wellbeing."
organisation = "BIOWELL package example"
organisation_website = "https://github.com/r-a-dobson/BIOWELL"
```

# <span style="color:#0097AD;">Section 2: Screening</span>

We recommend using this section to gain participant consent to the survey, following your organisations procedures and recommendations. This can involve a "no" option that will remove participants if they do not consent to involvement. 

+ `screen_message` - Text that appears at the top of the page containing the screening questions. 

+ `screen_questions` - A string (one question) or vector (2+ questions) containing questions that will be accompanies by a select box (drop down list) for responses. 

+ `screen_questions_ID` - A string or vector (same length as screen_questions) providing a unique ID for the screening questions. This is used in the resulting data frame of participant responses to avoid lengthy column names if question text is used. 

+ `screen_response_options` - A list, where each element contains a vector of response options for the screening questions. To set which responses should result in a participants removal from the survey, add ":SCREEN" to the end. 

Below are examples of how these arguments could be input:

```{r}
screen_message = "Consent to participate in research"

screen_questions = c(
  "I confirm I have read and understood the Participant Information Sheet for the Forest Questionnaire. I understand that my participation is voluntary and that I am free to withdraw at any time without giving any reason. I agree to take part in this research project.", # Question 1
  
  "What is your age?") # Question 2

screen_questions_ID = c("Consent", "Age") 

screen_response_options = list(c("No:SCREEN", "Yes"), # First element - choices for the first Q
                               c('0-17:SCREEN',  # Second element - choices for the second Q
                                 '18-29',  
                                 '30-59',
                                 'Over 60', 
                                 'Prefer not to say'))

# Here individuals will be removed if they answer "no" to the consent questions,
# and if they answer "0-17" to the age question.
```

# <span style="color:#0097AD;">Section 3: Start</span>

+ `start_message` - Text introducing the start questions to participants. 

+ `start_questions` - String (one question) or vector (2+ questions) containing text for each question to be asked prior to the BIO-WELL questions.

+ `start_questions_ID` - A string or vector (same length as `start_questions`) providing a unique ID for the start questions. This is used in the resulting data frame of participant responses to avoid lengthy column names if question text is used. 

+ `start_questions_type`- String or vector (length of `start_questions`) specifying the type of response box to provide for each `start_questions` (provide these in the same order as `start_questions`). We include five options:

  1) `text`: participants can freely type their responses.
  
  ![text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-a-dobson/BIO-WELL/main/man/V2/V2_1_1.png){width=75%}
  
  2) `selectbox`: participants can select one option from a drop down list.
  
  ![select box](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-a-dobson/BIO-WELL/main/man/V2/V2_1_2.png){width=75%}
  3) `checkbox`: participants can select one or more from list using check boxes.
  
  ![check box](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-a-dobson/BIO-WELL/main/man/V2/V2_1_3.png){width=75%}
   
  4) `likert_five`: participants can move a five-point slider of the likert.
  scale ("Strongly agree" to "Strongly disagree"). 
  
  ![Likert five](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-a-dobson/BIO-WELL/main/man/V2/V2_1_4.png){width=75%}
  
  5) `likert_seven`:
  participants can move a seven-point slider of the likert scale (includes
  "Somewhat agree" and "Somewhat disagree").
  
  ![Likert seven](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-a-dobson/BIO-WELL/main/man/V2/V2_1_5.png){width=75%}
  
+ `start_response_options` - list of vectors containing `selectbox` or
`checkbox` options for `start_questions.` The length of this list should be
equal to the number of `selectbox` or `checkbox` responses used in
`start_questions` and be in the order that these appear.

```{r}
start_questions = c(
  "How would you describe your gender?", # Q1
  "What country do you currently live in?", # Q2
  "Do you live in an area that you consider mainly…" # Q3
)

start_questions_ID = c("Gender", "Country", "Urbanicity") 

start_questions_type = c("selectbox", "selectbox", "selectbox") 

start_response_options = list(c('Male',  'Female',  'In another way', 'Prefer not to say'), # Q1 options
                               c('Scotland',  'England',  'Wales'), # Q2 options
                               c("Urban", "Rural")) # Q3 options
```

# <span style="color:#0097AD;">Section 4: BIO-WELL</span>

+ `biowell_situations`: Text for describing an introductory scenario to cognitively
situate the participant within a particular natural environment (i.e. a nearby
forest). 

+ `biowell_questions`: A list the length of `biowell_situations`, in which each
element contains a vector of the questions to be asked for each situation. 

These stem questions are asked about biodiversity metrics (e.g.
abundance, species diversity), as well as biodiversity attributes (e.g. smells,
colours, shapes) within each `biowell_situation` given. 

Table 2 demonstrates stem questions for a forest habitat. These can be
adapted to other environments and contexts through either direct modification
(e.g. change “woody smells” to “grassy smells” for urban parks) or through
additional empirical work (e.g. focus groups) to identify relevant attributes.

+ `biowell_situations_ID` - A string or vector (same length as
`biowell_situations`) providing a unique ID for each situation.

+ `biowell_questions_ID`- A list the length of `biowell_situations` containing a
string or vector the same length as the equivalent list element in `biowell_questions`, providing a unique ID for each bio-well question.

The above are used in the resulting data frame of participant responses to avoid
lengthy column names if situation/question text is used.

This is essentially a repeat of the Start section, but allows you to ask
questions following the BIO-WELL questions have been answered.

+ `end_message` - Text introducing the end questions to participants.

+ `end_questions`- String (one question) or vector (2+ questions) containing
text for each question to be asked following the BIO-WELL questions.

+ `all_sliders` - Logical (`TRUE` or `FALSE`) specifying whether all `biowell_questions` sliders need to be moved to continue with the survey. If `TRUE`, a message stating this to participants will appear by the next button.  

# <span style="color:#0097AD;">Finalising your survey</span>
 
When you are working on your custom BIO-WELL survey using `build_survey()`,
ensure that you are working within the BIO-WELL survey folder that you created
at the start of the Vignette.

Once you are happy with the layout of your BIO-WELL survey, save the R script
containing your `BIOWELL::build_survey()` input as "app.R" inside the folder created for
your BIO-WELL survey. Ensure that no other lines of code are included in this script, and that the `build_survey()` function is called using the double colon operator. 

+ `BW_app_path` - Path to the folder for your BIO-WELL survey. This should
contain your Dropbox token within a .secrets folder already (see Vignette 1 -
`activate_dropbox()`).

+ `Dropbox_App_folder` - Name of the folder within your Dropbox App (see Vignette 1)
for response data to be stored within.

## <span style="color:#004A86;">Example survey code to run </span>

The code below contains the full input for running our example Shiny App
