# <span style="color:#0097AD;">Introduction </span>

The `BIOWELL` package includes functions for building a custom survey in `Shiny`
using the BIO-WELL scale and sharing the survey with
participants via the internet by deploying them onto the [Posit Shiny Server](https://posit.co/products/open-source/shinyserver/).

In this vignette, we will outline how to generate a long-lived
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) access token for storing response data from
your BIO-WELL survey.

## <span style="color:#004A86;">Why is this important?</span>

When your survey is uploaded to the [Posit Shiny
Server](https://posit.co/products/open-source/shinyserver/), participant
response data cannot be stored locally. Therefore, the `BIOWELL` package
integrates Dropbox for free remote storage of survey response data.

To store data to a Dropbox account over long periods of time, an access token
needs to be generated and stored where your Shiny BIO-WELL survey can access it
whilst uploaded to the [Posit Shiny Server](https://posit.co/products/open-source/shinyserver/).

To find out more about access tokens for applications, including Dropbox, visit [this website](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/).

**You only need to do this once when creating your BIO-WELL survey!** 

# <span style="color:#0097AD;">Step 1: Installation</span>

Before starting, install the `BIOWELL` and `rdrop2` packages in R. Then load the
libraries.

```{r setup}
# install.packages("BIOWELL")
# install.packages("rdrop2")
library(BIOWELL)
library(rdrop2)
```

# <span style="color:#0097AD;">Step 2: BIO-WELL survey folder </span>

Throughout the `BIOWELL` framework, your BIO-WELL survey will need to have its
own folder. This is where you will save an R script named 'app.R' which
contains the survey script (`build_survey()` - Vignette 2), as well as the
Dropbox access token (Vignette 1).

Let's create a folder to store our BIOWELL survey and associated data to!

```{r app_directory}
path_to_folder <- tempdir() # Replace with path to a local folder. 

appName <- "my_app_name" # Replace with name for your app. 

dir.create(paste0(path_to_folder,"/",appName)) 
```

# <span style="color:#0097AD;">Step 3: Dropbox account</span>

Next, you need to create a free account on the [Dropbox website](https://www.dropbox.com/).

# <span style="color:#0097AD;">Step 4: Dropbox App</span>

To save your survey data into, you now need to create a [Dropbox app](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create?_tk=pilot_lp&_ad=ctabtn1&_camp=create) within your Dropbox account. 

Here you should:

* Select "scoped access"

* Select "app folder"

* Choose a name for your app

# <span style="color:#0097AD;">Step 5: Dropbox App set-up</span>

Now you can access your [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps?_tk=pilot_lp&_ad=topbar4&_camp=myapps).

Scroll down to OAUTH2: Redirect URIs and add http://localhost:1410/

![Add redirect URI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-a-dobson/BIO-WELL/main/man/V1/V1_2.png){width=75%}

Then, go to the Permissions tab and tick the relevant boxes. You need to give
the app permission to read and write files.

![Add Dropbox App permissions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-a-dobson/BIO-WELL/main/man/V1/V1_3.png){width=75%}

Return back to the app's Settings tab, and scroll down to reveal your app's key
and secret. This is required for activating the access token! Remember to never
share your app's key and secret.

[Get Dropbox name, key and secret](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-a-dobson/BIO-WELL/main/man/V1/V1_4.png){width=75%}


Let's save our Dropbox App details in the R environment. 

```{r dropbox_app}
Dropbox_App_Name <- "my_app_name" # Replace with your Dropbox App name. 

Dropbox_App_Key <- "string-of-letters-and-numbers" # Replace with your Dropbox App key.  

Dropbox_App_Secret <- "string-of-letters-and-numbers" # Replace with your Dropbox App secret. 
```


# <span style="color:#0097AD;">Step 6: Activate Dropbox access token</span>

Now you have all the details needed to generate the Dropbox access token. Run
the code below. This will open a window in your browser to authenticate the
token. 

**Remember to provide the function with the path to the BIO-WELL survey folder (`BW_app_path`) that
you created in Step 1 of the vignette.**

```{r activate_token, eval=FALSE}
activate_dropbox(Dropbox_App_Name = Dropbox_App_Name,
                 Dropbox_App_Key = Dropbox_App_Key,
                 Dropbox_App_Secret = Dropbox_App_Secret,
                 BW_app_path = paste0(path_to_folder,"/",appName))
```


Once you have authenticated the token, the token will be saved in a ".secrets"
folder within your BIO-WELL survey directory.

When you upload your BIO-WELL survey to the Shiny servers, it will now be able
to remotely store survey responses to your Dropbox App folder. These data can be
retrieved using the `BIOWELL` package's `download_data()` function.
