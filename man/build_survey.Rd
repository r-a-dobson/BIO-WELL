\section{BIO-WELL survey structure}{
\itemize{
\item Screening: This section allows you to set questions where certain responses
will prevent users from completing the survey. For instance, if they are not
of a certain age, or do not consent their involvement.
\item Start: This section allows you to set questions that come before the BIO-WELL
questions. For example, these may be generic questions, such as gaining
information on a participant's location, gender or employment.
\item BIO-WELL: The questions in this section are all accompanied by the five
sliders that comprise the BIO-WELL scale. For each situation given (although
often there may be only be one environment of interest), a new page is added
to the survey. See Irvine et al., (2023) for more details on the BIO-WELL
scale and survey set-up, including the BIO-WELL stem questions.
}
\enumerate{
\item \code{biowell_situations}: Text for describing an introductory scenario to
cognitively situate the participant within a particular natural environment
(i.e. a nearby forest).
\item \code{biowell_questions}: A list the length of \code{biowell_situations}, in which
each element contains a vector of the questions to be asked for each
situation. These stem questions are asked about biodiversity metrics (e.g.
abundance, species diversity), as well as biodiversity attributes (e.g.
smells, colours, shapes) within each \code{biowell_situation} given.
}
\itemize{
\item End: This section allows you to set questions that follow the BIO-WELL
questions. This may include asking participants for their contact details or
questions that may help disentangle patterns in BIO-WELL scores, such as
whether individuals spend a lot of time outdoors.
\item Report: This section will calculate the participants average BIO-WELL score
across the five wellbeing domains in the BIO-WELL scale (physical, emotional,
cognitive, social and spiritual) and provide users with an interpretation of
their BIO-WELL score, including a comparison with other survey participants.
}
}

\section{Structure: messages, question, IDs, types and options.}{
Each section can be specified using arguments relating to the following
aspects:
\subsection{Messages}{

Text that will accompany each section or display throughout the survey.
}

\subsection{Questions and IDs}{

Questions provide the exact text for each question to ask participants.

IDs provide shorted versions or codes for each question within the survey.
These are then used in the output survey response data frame to prevent
lengthy column names. For example, the question "The variety of textures in
this forest makes me feelâ€¦" could be given the ID "Variety of textures".
}

\subsection{Response types and options}{

There are five response type options to accompany non-BIO-WELL questions.
These include:
\enumerate{
\item \code{text} - A simple text box that the participant can type their answer
into.
\item \code{selectbox}* - A drop down box that the participant can choose one
answer from.
\item \code{checkbox}* - A group of check boxes that the participant can choose multiple
or none of. Be aware that if \code{all_questions = TRUE}, participants will have to
select one of the check boxes, and so it is best to include an option for
selecting none of the options below.
\item \code{likert_five} - A five point Likert scale going from "strongly
agree" to "strongly disagree".
\item \code{likert_seven} - A seven point Likert scale that also includes
"somewhat agree" and "somewhat disagree".
}

*For \code{selectbox} and \code{checkbox} response types, you will need to set the options
that participants will have. This can be done using the "...response_options"
arguments.

To specify this, for each \code{selectbox} and \code{checkbox} response type in each
section, create a list of equal length to the number of these response types.
Each element within the list should contain a character vector of the options.

For example:

start_questions <- c("How old are you?",
"What is your current employment?",
"Which of the following pets do you own?")

start_questions_ID <- c("Age","Employment","Pets")

start_questions_type <- c("selectbox", "text", "checkbox")

start_response_options <- list(c("0-17", "18-49", "51 +"),
c("dog", "cat", "rabbit", "fish", "snake"))
}
}

\section{Screening questions}{
Screening questions offer you the opportunity to remove participants from
taking part in the survey if they do not meet certain criteria. These will all
be \code{selectbox} response types. To specify how to screen participants, add
":SCREEN" to the response options for which, if chosen, the participant should
be removed.

For example, if participants do not consent or are under 18, they will be
removed from the following survey:

screen_questions <- c("Do you consent to this study?","How old are you?")

screen_questions_ID <- c("Consent","Age")

screen_response_options <- list(c("No:SCREEN", "Yes"),
c("0-17:SCREEN", "18-49", "51+"))
}

\section{Happy with your BIO-WELL survey design?}{
Once you have customised your survey, you need to save the R script as "app.R"
within a designated folder for your BIOWELL survey Shiny App.

This R script should contain nothing other than "BIOWELL::build_survey()" with
the arguments to the function in-filled between the brackets. See Vignette 3
for more details.

You can then deploy your survey onto the Shiny Server using the \code{create_URL()}
function.
}

\section{Language options}{
The BIO-WELL response sliders can be generated in 31 different languages. The
language for your study can be specified using the \code{language} argument. The
available options are: + \code{arabic} + \code{bengali_india} + \code{chinese_hong_kong} +
\code{chinese_taiwan} + \code{danish} + \code{dutch} + \code{edo} + \code{english} + \code{finnish} +
\code{french} + \code{german} + \code{gujarati} + \code{indonesian} + \code{irish} + \code{italian} +
\code{japanese} + \code{korean} + \code{malay} + \code{norwegian} + \code{polish} + \code{portuguese} +
\code{portuguese_brasil} + \code{punjabi_india} + \code{punjabi_pakistan} + \code{russian} +
\code{scottish_gaelic} + \code{spanish} + \code{swedish} + \code{urdu_india} + \code{urdu_pakistan} +
\code{welsh}.

Please see Vignette 2 in the \code{BIOWELL} package for full guidance on this
function.
