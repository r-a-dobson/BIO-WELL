\section{BIO-WELL survey Shiny App structure}{
\itemize{
\item Screening: This section allows you to set questions where certain responses
will prevent users from completing the survey. For instance, if they are not
of a certain age, or do not consent their involvement.
\item Start: This section allows you to set questions that precede the BIO-well
questions. For example, these may be generic questions, such as gaining
information on participants location, gender or employment.
\item BIO-WELL: The questions in this section are all responded to be participants
using the five sliders that comprise the BIO-WELL scale. For each situation
given (although often there may be only be one environment of interest), a new
page is added to the survey. See Irvine et al., (2023) for more details on the
BIO-WELL scale and survey set-up.
\item End: This section allows you to set questions that follow the BIO-WELL
questions. This may include asking participants for their contact details or
questions that may help disentangle patterns in BIO-WELL scores, such as
whether individuals spend a lot of time outdoors.
\item Report: This section will calculate the participants average BIO-WELL score
across the five wellbeing domains in the BIO-WELL scale (physical, emotional,
cognitive, social and spiritual) and provide users some interpretation of
their BIO-WELL scores compared to other survey participants.
}
}

\section{Structure: messages, question, IDs, types and options.}{
Each section can be specified using arguments relating to the following aspects:
\subsection{Messages}{

Text that will accompany each section or display throughout the survey.
}

\subsection{Questions and IDs}{

Questions provide the exact text for each question to ask participants.

IDs provide shorted versions or codes for each question that can be used in
the output data frame or participants responses. This streamlines the data
frame and facilitates analyses of results.

For example, the question "The variety of textures in this forest makes me
feelâ€¦" could be given the ID "Variety of textures", so that output data frame
and plots do not have lengthy names.
}

\subsection{Response types and options}{

There are five response type options to accompany non-bio-well questions.
These include:
\enumerate{
\item text - This is a simple text box that the participant can type their answer
into.
\item selectbox* - This is a drop down box that the participant can choose one
answer from.
\item checkbox* - This is a list of checkboxes that the participant can choose
multiple or none of.
\item likert_five - This is a five point likert slider scale going from "strongly
agree" to "strongly disagree".
\item likert_seven - This is a seven point likert slider scale that also includes
"somewhat agree" and "somewhat disagree".
}

For selectbox and checkbox response types, you will want to set the options
that participants have available to them. This can be done using the
"...response_options" arguments.

*To specify this, for each selectbox and checkbox response type in each
section, create a list the same length, with each element within the list
containing a vector of options for each. This must be in the same order as
the questions come within the section.

For example:
start_questions <- c("How old are you?",
"What is your current employment?",
"Which of the following pets do you own?")
start_questions_ID <- c("Age","Employment","Pets")
start_questions_type <- c("selectbox", "text", "checkbox")
start_response_options <- list(c("0-17", "18-49", "51+"),
c("dog", "cat", "rabbit", "fish", "snake"))
}
}

\section{Screening questions}{
Screening questions offer you the opportunity to remove participants from
taking part if they do not meet certain criteria. These all must be selectbox
response types. It is recommended to set the screening answer as the first
option, as it will default to this and so users will have to actively deselect
them to continue. This can be done by adding ":SCREEN" to the response options
for which, if chosen, the participant should be removed.

For example:
screen_questions <- c("Do you consent to this study?","How old are you?")
screen_questions_ID <- c("Consent","Age")
screen_response_options <- list(c("No:SCREEN", "Yes"),
c("0-17:SCREEN", "18-49", "51+"))
}

\section{Happy with your BIO-WELL survey design?}{
Once you have customised your survey, you need to save the R script as "app.R"
with a designated folder for your BIOWELL survey Shiny App.

This R script should contain nothing other than "BIOWELL::build_survey()" with
the arguments to the function in-filled between the brackets. See Vignette 3
for more details.

You can then deploy your survey onto the Shiny Server using the \code{create_URL()}
function.
