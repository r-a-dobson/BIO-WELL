\title{Evaluate BIO-WELL survey}
\usage{
evaluate_survey(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame containing the combined response data frames from a
\code{BIOWELL} package survey. See \code{download_data()} to obtain this.}
}
\value{
Returns a list containing a data frame of processed BIO-WELL scores,
Cronbach's alpha statistic and item-total.
}
\description{
Function to calculate key survey evaluation statistics on BIO-WELL survey
responses.
}
\details{
Once you have combined all responses to your BIO-WELL survey into a single
data frame using the \code{download_data()} function, this data frame can be input
into \code{evaluate_survey()}.

\code{evaluate_survey()} returns three outputs in a list object:
\enumerate{
\item A processed data frame containing the average BIO-WELL scores for each
participant for each question within your custom \code{BIOWELL} package survey.
\item Cronbach's Alpha
}

The computed Cronbach's Alpha statistic measures the reliability, or internal
consistency, of the five wellbeing sliders . This can be calculated for each
biodiversity statement and will help understand the strength or consistency
with which the sliders collectively measure a biopsychosocial-spiritual model
of wellbeing. The resulting alpha statistic can be compared to those obtained
in the original Irvine et al. (2023) article. This is calculated using
\code{cronbach.alpha()} function from the \code{ltm} R package (Rizopoulos et al.,
2007).
\enumerate{
\item Item-total correlation: the computed item-total statistic for each BIO-WELL
question  within your survey (Cronbach et al., 1951). This assesses how
strongly scores on one wellbeing slider are related to scores on all the other
wellbeing sliders. It also contributes to understanding the reliability of the
wellbeing sliders as a measure of a biopsychosocial-spiritual model of
wellbeing. This is calculated using the \code{item.total()} function from the
\code{multilevel} \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=multilevel}{R package}.
