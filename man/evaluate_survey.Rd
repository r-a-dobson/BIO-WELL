\title{Evaluate BIO-WELL survey}
\usage{
evaluate_survey(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame containing the combined response data frames from a
\code{BIOWELL} package survey. See \code{download_data()} to obtain this.}
}
\value{
Returns a list containing a data frame of processed BIO-WELL scores,
Cronbach's alpha statistic and item-total.
}
\description{
Function to calculate key survey evaluation statistics on BIO-WELL survey
responses.
}
\details{
Once you have combined all responses to your BIO-WELL survey into a single
data frame using the \code{download_data()} function, this data frame can be input
into \code{evaluate_survey()}.

\code{evaluate_survey()} returns six outputs in a list object:
}
\section{Stem question statistics:}{
The first three components are derived from the BIO-WELL score for each stem
question, calculated by averaging slider responses across the five well-being
domains.
\enumerate{
\item A processed data frame containing the average BIO-WELL scores for each
participant for each stem question within your custom \code{BIOWELL} package survey.
\item Cronbach's Alpha: the computed Cronbach's Alpha statistic measures the
reliability, or internal consistency, of the five wellbeing sliders . This can
be calculated for each biodiversity statement and will help understand the
strength or consistency with which the sliders collectively measure a
biopsychosocial-spiritual model of wellbeing. The resulting alpha statistic
can be compared to those obtained in the original Irvine et al. (2023)
article. This is calculated using \code{cronbach.alpha()} function from the \code{ltm} R
package (Rizopoulos et al., 2007).
\item Item-total correlation and Cronbach's Alpha-without: the computed
item-total statistic for each BIO-WELL question  within your survey (Cronbach
et al., 1951). This assesses how strongly scores on one wellbeing slider are
related to scores on all the other wellbeing sliders. It also contributes to
understanding the reliability of the wellbeing sliders as a measure of a
biopsychosocial-spiritual model of wellbeing. Alpha without is the Cronbach
Alpha reliability estimate of the scale without the variable. This is
calculated using the \code{item.total()} function from the \code{multilevel} \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=multilevel}{R package}.
}
}

\section{Wellbeing domain x question:}{
The latter three components are derived from the slider responses for each of the
five wellbeing domains within each stem question (total stem questions x five).
\enumerate{
\item A processed data frame containing the score for each wellbeing domain slider
within each stem question given by each participant in your custom \code{BIOWELL}
package survey dataset.
\item Cronbach's alpha (see 2 for description)
\item Item-total correlation and Cronbach's Alpha-without (see 3 for description)
